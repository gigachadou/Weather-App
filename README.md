# 🌤️ Weather App

## Purpose of this repository

This repository contains a **simple Weather App** built to practice modern frontend development with **React**. The project currently uses a clean **Vite + React** template and will be extended step‑by‑step with real weather data, UI improvements, and best practices.

The main goal of this project is:

* Learn React fundamentals in a real project
* Practice working with APIs (later)
* Build a clean and understandable project structure
* Prepare a solid base for future features

---

## Tech Stack

* ⚡ **Vite** – fast development environment
* ⚛️ **React** – UI library
* 🧱 **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – core web technologies
